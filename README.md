# CDK Private S3 Hosting Construct

This is a CDK construct that creates a private S3 bucket and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a listener rule that forwards requests to the S3 bucket.

You can use this construct for a enterprise use case where you want to host a static website in a private network.

Original idea is from [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/hosting-internal-https-static-websites-with-alb-s3-and-privatelink/).
